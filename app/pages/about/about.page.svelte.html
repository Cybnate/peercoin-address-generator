    <div class="title">About</div>
    <p>This Wallet Generator was build from scratch for Peercoin.</p>
    <p>The main focus is to deliver a good and fast experience for mobile users, which seem forsaken by classic wallet generators. We're using cutting edge browser technologies in order to deliver this better experience, so please understand that older browsers may not work as expected (or at all) with this application.</p>

    <div class="title">Peercoin</div>
    <p>Peercoin is the first cryptocurrency to implement the hybrid Proof of Work (POW) and Proof of Stake (POS) algorithm. Created in 2012, it's been running for more than <b>{{timeAlive()}} years</b> with considerably less energy than pure PoW cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Along those {{timeAlive()}} years Peercoin also never had any type involvement with pre-mining, fraudulent ICOs or any critical security breaches.</p>

    <div class="title">Disclaimer</div>

The owner of the wallet generated is responsible for its money and thus should follow all security steps in order to keep them safe. We do our best to keep this tool as up-to-date and secure as possible. This tool is 100% open-source. If you find any bugs or issues, please report to our repository.</p>
